Hello, I’m @john-hafner, a developer with over ten years experience working for the State of Michigan in the Department
of Technology, Management, and Budget supporting the Department of Health & Human Services.  Or I work for DTMB supporting DHHS, and
now you see why we have so many abbreviations & acronyms!

I've worked in full stack development on enterprise java web applications, desktop apps, and lately have segued into data analysis
and visualization where we utilize the information in our application logs to monitor system health and provide business intelligence
to our customers using Splunk.

I'm currently learning Node JS as part of a rewrite of a work tool to bring it up to security standards.
